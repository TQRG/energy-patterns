- name: Dark UI Colors
  description: Provide a dark UI color theme to save battery on devices with AMOLED screens.
  context: Screen is one of the major source of power consumption on mobile devices. Apps that require heavy usage of screen (e.g., reading apps) can have a big impact on battery life.
  solution: Provide a UI with dark background colors. This is particularly beneficial for mobile devices with AMOLED screens, which are more energy efficient when displaying dark colors. In some cases, it might be reasonable to allow users to choose between a light and a dark theme. The dark theme can also be activated using a special trigger (e.g., when battery is running low).
  example: In a reading app, provide a theme with a dark background using light colors to display text. When compared to themes using light backgrounds, a dark background will have a higher number of dark pixels.

- name: Dynamic Retry Delay
  figure: dynamic_retry_delay.svg
  description: Whenever an attempt to access a resource has failed, increase the interval of time waited before asking access to that same resource.
  context: The mobile app has some features that require collecting data from other resources (e.g., update information from server). However, in same cases if the resource is unavailable, the app will unnecessarily try to connect the resource for a number of times, leading to unnecessary power consumption.
  solution: Increase update interval after each failed connection. It can be either a linear or exponential growth. Update interval can be reset upon a successful connection or a given change in the context (e.g., network status)).

- name: Avoid Extraneous Work
  description: Avoid performing tasks that are not visible/valuable to the user and/or quickly become obsolete.
  context: Mobile apps have to perform a number of tasks simultaneously. There are cases in which the result of those tasks is not visible (e.g., the UI is presenting other pieces of information), or the result is not necessarily relevant to the user. This is particularly critical when apps go to the background. Since the data quickly becomes obsolete, the phone is using resources unnecessarily.
  solution: Select a concise set of data that should be presented to the user and enable/disable update and processing tasks depending on their effect on the data that is visible or valuable to the user.
  example: Consider a time series plot that needs to display real-time data. The plot has to be constantly updated — if the user scrolls down a UI view and the plot becomes hidden, the app should cease drawing operations related with the plot.

    - Open Only When Necessary
  description: Release resources or services as soon as possible (e.g., wakelocks, screen).
  context: Mobile apps use a number of resources that can be manually closed after use. While active, these resources are ready to respond to requests from the app and require extra power consumption.
  solution: Make sure resources are inactive when they are not necessary by manually closing them.
  example: Implement handlers for events that are fired when the app goes to background, and release wake locks accordingly.

  description: Open/start resources/services only when they are strictly necessary.
  context: Some resources require to be manually opened before use. It might be tempting to open necessary resources at the beginning of some task (e.g., upon the creation of an activity). However, resources will be actively waiting for requests, and consequently spending more energy.
  solution: Open resources only when necessary. This also avoids activating resources that will never be used.
  example: In a mobile app for video calls, only start capturing video at the moment that it will be displayed to the user.

- name: Push Over Poll
  figure: push_not_poll.svg
  description: Use push notifications to receive updates from resources, instead of actively querying resources (i.e., polling).
  context: Mobile apps need to get updates from resources (e.g., from server). One way of checking for updates is by periodically query those resources. However, this will lead to several requests that will return no update, leading to unnecessary energy consumption.
  solution: Use push notifications to get updates from resources. Note -- this is a big challenge amongst FOSS apps since there is no good open source alternative for Firebase Cloud Messaging (former Google Cloud Messaging).
  example: In a messaging app, instead of actively check for new messages, the app can subscribe push notifications.

    - Power Awareness
  description: Provide an energy efficient mode in which user experience can drop for the sake of better energy usage.
  context: Whenever the device battery is running low, users want to avoid losing connectivity before they reach a power charging station. If the device shuts down, users might miss important calls or will not be able to do an important task. Still, apps might be running unimportant tasks that will reduce battery life in this critical context.
  solution: The app provides a power save mode in which it uses less resources while providing the minimum functionality that is indispensable to the user. It can be activated manually or upon some power events (e.g., when battery reaches a given level). User experience can drop for the sake of energy efficiency. Note, this is enforced in iOS for some use cases if the apps use the BackgroundSync APIs.
  example: Deactivate some features, reduce update intervals, or deactivate animated effects in the UI.

    - Power Save Mode
  description: Have a different behavior when device is connected/disconnected to a power station, or has different battery levels.
  context: There are some features that are not strictly necessary to users although they improve user experience (e.g., UI animations). Moreover, there are operations that do not have high priority and do not need to execute immediately (e.g., backup data in the cloud).
  solution: Enable or disable tasks or features according to power status. Since when the device is connected to power, the battery might still be running low, it might be advisable to wait until a pre-defined battery level is reached (or the power save mode is deactivated).
  example: Delay intensive operations such as cloud syncing or image processing until the device is connected to a charger.
  warning: According to https://github.com/nextcloud/ios/issues/22 this is only feasible for Android.

  description: When transmitting data, reduce its size as much as possible.
  figure: reduce_size.svg
  context: Data transmition is a common operation in mobile apps. However, such operations are energy greedy and the time of transmission should reduced as much as possible.
  solution: Exchange only what is strictly necessary, avoiding sending unnecessary data. Use data compression when possible.
  example: When performing HTTP requests use gzip content encoding to compress data.

    - Power Awareness
  description: Delay or disable heavy data connections until the device is connected to a WiFi network.
  context: Data needs to be syncronized with a server but it is not urgent and can be delayed.
  solution: Data connections using cellular networks are usually more battery intensive than connections using WiFi. Low priority operations that require a data connection to exchange considerable amounts of data should be delayed until a WiFi connection is available.
  example: Consider a mobile app to organize photos that allows users to backup their photos in a cloud server. Use an API to check the availability of a WiFi connection and postpone cloud synchronizing in case it cannot be reached.

    - Avoid Extraneous Work
  description: Avoid using intensive logging (< 1Hz).
  context: Developers resort to logging in their mobile apps to ensure their correct behavior and simplify bug reporting. However, logging operations are creating overhead on energy consumption without creating value to the end user.
  solution: Avoid using intensive logging, and keeping rates below one message per second.
  example: Disable logging when processing real-time data. If necessary enable only during debugging executions.

- name: Batch Operations
  aka: Lazy First — Coalesce, Inexact Schedulling
  description: Batch multiple operations, instead of putting the device into an active state many times.
  figure: batch_operations.svg
  context: 1) Background tasks can be expensive. A given task needs to be eventually executed, but it does not need to be executed in a specific time. 2) Executing operations separately might incurr in tail energy consumptions.
  solution: Bundle multiple operations in a single one.
  example: "Use Job Scheduling APIs (e.g., `android.app.job.JobScheduler`, Firebase JobDispatcher) that manage multiple background tasks occurring in a device. These APIs will guarantee that device will exit when there is a reasonable amount of work to do. It combines several multiple tasks to prevent the device from constantly exiting sleep mode (or doze mode). Other examples: execute only if another task is using the required resource; ask for location while setting 'notification responsiveness' with a reasonable delay; try to collect location data when other apps are collecting it as well."

- name: Cache
  aka: Lazy First — reduce
  description: Avoid performing unnecessary operations by using cache mechanisms.
  context: Typically mobile apps present data to users that is collect from a remote server. However, it may happen that the same data is being collected from the server multiple times.
  solution: Implement caching mechanisms to temporarily store data from server. In addition, verify whether there is an update before downloading all data.
  example: Consider a social network app that shows other users' profiles. Instead of downloading basic information and profile pictures every time a given profile is opened, use data that was locally stored from earlier visits.

    - Enough resolution
  description: Increase time between syncs/sensor reads as much as possible.
  context: Mobile apps have to periodically perform operations. If a the time between two executions is small, the app will be executing operations more often. In some cases, even if operations are executed more often, it will not affect users' perception.
  solution:  Increase the delay between operations to find the minimal interval that do not compromise user experience. This delay can be manually tuned by developers or defined by users. More sophisticated solutions can also use context (e.g., time of the day, history data, etc.) to infer the optimal update rate.
  example: Consider a news app that collects news from different sources, each one having its own thread. Some news sources might have new content only once a week, while others might be updated every hour. Instead of updating all threads at the same rate, use data from previous updates to infer the optimal update rate of these threads. Connect to the news source only if new updates are expected.

- name: User Knows Best
  description: Allow users to enable/disable certain features in order to save energy.
  context: Energy efficiency solutions often provide a tradeoff between features and power consumption. However, this tradeoff is different for different users. I.e., some users might be okay with less features but better energy efficiency, and vice versa.
  solution: Allow users to customize their preferences regarding energy critical features. Since this might be more intuitive for power users, mobile apps should provide by optimal preferences by default for regular users.
  example: Consider a mail client for POP3 accounts as example. In some cases, users are not expecting any urgent message and are okay with checking for new mail in no less than 10 minutes for the sake of energy efficiency. On the other hand, there are cases in which users are waiting for urgent messages and would like to check for messages every two minutes. Since there is no automatic mechanism to infer the optimal update interval, the best option is to allow users to define it.

- name: Inform Users
  figure: inform_users.svg
  description: Let the user know if the app is doing any battery intensive operation.
  context: There are specific use cases in mobile apps that can be energy greedy. On the other hand some features might be dropping user experience in order to improve energy efficiency. If users do not know what to expect from the mobile app, they might think it is not behaving correctly.
  solution: Let users know about battery intensive operations or energy management features. Properly flag this information in the user interface (e.g., alerts).
  example: Examples include alerting users when the saving power mode is active, and alerting when a battery intensive operation is executed.

- name: Enough resolution
  description: Collect or provide high accuracy data only when strictly necessary.
  context: When collecting or displaying data, it is tempting to use high resolutions. The problem of using data with high resolution is that its collection and manipulation require more resources (e.g., memory, processing capacity, etc.). As a consequence, energy consumption increases unnecessarily.
  solution: For every use case, find the optimal resolution value that is required to provide the intended user experience.
  example: Consider a running app that is able to record running sessions. While  the user is running, the app presents the current overall distance in real-time. While calculating the most accurate value of the total distance would provide the correct information, it would require precise real-time processing of GPS or accelerometer sensors, which can be energy greedy. Instead, a lightweight method could be used to estimate this information with lower but reasonable accuracy. In the end of the session, the accurate results would still processed, but without real-time constraints.

  description: Use data from low power sensors to infer whether new data needs to be collected from high power sensors
  context: Mobile apps provide features that require reading data or executing operations in different sensors or components. Such operations can be energy greedy, causing high power consumption. Thus, they should be called as less times as possible.
  solution: Use complementaray data low power sensors to assure whether a given energy-greedy operation needs to be executed.
  example: Use accelerometer to infer whether the user has changed location. In the case that the user is in the same location, data from GPS does not need to be updated.

  related: enough resolution
  description: Graphics and animations are really important to improve user experience. However, they can also be battery intensive – use them with moderation.
  context: Mobile apps often feature impressive graphics and animations. However, they need to be properly tuned in order to prevent battery drain of users' devices. This is particularly critical in e-paper devices.
  solution: Study the importance of graphics and animations to the user experience. The improvement on user experience may not be sufficient to cover the overhead on energy consumption. Avoid using graphics animations or high quality graphics. Resort to low frame rates for animations when possible.
  example: A high frame rate may make sense during game play, but a lower frame rate may be sufficient for a menu screen. Use a high frame rate only when the user experience calls for it.
  warning: Particularly important on e-ink devices. TODO - Review 'Enough Resolution'.

    - User Knows Best
  description: Perform tasks only when the user specifically asks.
  context: Some tasks can be energy intensive, but not strictly necessary for some use cases of the app.
  solution: Provide a mechanism in the UI (e.g., button) that allows users to trigger energy intensive tasks.
  example: In a beacon monitoring app, there are situations in which the user does not need to keep track of her/his beacons. Allow the user to start/stop monitoring manually.

# - name: Kill the battery optimizer (anti pattern)
#   description: Most battery optimizers are actually app killers. However, very often users are not aware of the implications of battery optimiers that are running on their devices. Thus, users assume that apps are misfunctioning due to their poor quality.
